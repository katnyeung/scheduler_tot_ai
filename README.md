# Experimental New Era of Programming

Welcome to our experimental projectâ€”an exploration of the future of programming where advanced AI reasoning meets persistent vector memory. This repository demonstrates how to rethink traditional decision-making with a novel Tree of Thought (ToT) approach, integrating Spring AI, vector databases, and autonomous scheduling.

## Overview

In this project, we explore:
- **Scheduling**: Trigger tasks at specific times or events.
- **Tree of Thought (ToT)**: A hierarchical decision-making framework for reasoning through complex tasks.
- **Actions**: Execute tasks based on ToT decisions.
- **Refinement**: Continuously improve the ToT based on outcomes and feedback.

## Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the Scheduler, Tree of Thought (ToT), Action, and Refinement:

### Workflow

1. **Scheduler**:
   - Triggers actions at predefined intervals or events.
2. **Action**:
   - Fetches the ToT from the vector database.
   - Evaluates the current state using an LLM.
   - Executes tasks based on ToT decisions.
3. **Refinement**:
   - Updates the ToT based on feedback from executed actions.
   - Writes refined nodes back to the vector database for future use.

## Use Case Example: Autonomous Stock Analyst

Imagine a system that monitors the NVDA stock price throughout the trading day:

1. **ToT Creation**:  
   - Analyze critical points to determine the best price to buy NVDA stock.
   - Create a Tree of Thought (ToT) based on multiple criteria, such as price thresholds, market trends, and volatility.
   - Nodes in the ToT represent decisions:
     - **Left Branch**: Leads to "Good," indicating it's a good time to buy.
     - **Right Branch**: Leads to "Hold," meaning conditions are not ideal, and monitoring should continue.

2. **Scheduling**:  
   - Schedule the action to trigger at market open (e.g., 9:30 AM EST).
   - Repeat every 15 minutes during trading hours to evaluate the ToT.

3. **Action**:  
   - Fetch the ToT from the vector database and evaluate it using the LLM.
   - If the ToT returns "Good," send an email alert recommending a buy action.
   - If the ToT returns "Hold," do nothing and wait for the next scheduled evaluation.

4. **Refinement**:  
   - Post-action, analyze the outcome (e.g., actual stock price movements and market conditions).
   - Refine the ToT:
     - Update thresholds or criteria for "Good" and "Hold" decisions.
     - Add new nodes if additional conditions or factors are identified.
   - Save the updated ToT back into the vector database for future evaluations.

## Sample Node Representation (Stored in the Vector DB)

{
"content": "Check if NVDA price is below today's low",
"metadata": {
"nodeId": "node_001",
"type": "decision",
"treeId": "nvda_alert_tree",
"children": {
"yes": "node_002",
"no": "node_003"
},
"prompt": "Is the current NVDA price lower than the recorded day's low?"
}
}

## Why This Matters

This project embodies a truly experimental approach to programming:
- **Flexibility**: By decoupling decision logic (ToT) from execution, you can easily modify or extend the system in real time.
- **Context Awareness**: With vector storage for node semantics, the AI can consider detailed context in its reasoning.
- **Self-Improvement**: The action/refinement cycle ensures the system learns from each decision, potentially leading to smarter automation over time.
